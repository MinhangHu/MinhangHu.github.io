I'm a first year graduate student from [School of ESE](https://ese.nju.edu.cn/), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision and computational photography.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Tao Yue](https://computationalperceptionlab.github.io/member/assert/Yuetao/index.html) of [Nanjing University Computation Perception Lab](https://computationalperceptionlab.github.io), Nanjing University.
